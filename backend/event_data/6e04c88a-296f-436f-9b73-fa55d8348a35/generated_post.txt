Here's aLinkedIn post created with your requirements, keeping in mind the limited, somewhat unique information provided. Because the event itself seems very informal based on the transcription, this attempts to maintain a level of professionalism while acknowledging that. Two slightly different versions (one leans a little more energetic) are proposed - review both and use whichever feels more in line with your usual brand/voice.

**(OPTION 1 â€“  Professional, Focused)**

Had the sneak peek behind the curtain today â€“ got a demo showcasing some incredible new mobile app features and significant performance boosts! ðŸ’ª 

The team has been clearly focused on optimization and user experience improvements, and seeing it firsthand was truly compelling.  We got a quick (unofficial!) reveal â€“ highlighting some really impressive changes.  This signals the team is focused on continuing app excellence and a commitment towards future-proofing the platform.

Really looking forward to sharing more when the official release is unveiled â€“ I've got a feeling this will be a big leap for our application! Exciting times ahead! ðŸ™Œ

**(Option 2 â€“ Slightly more Energetic, acknowledging the informal feel)**

Quick but impactful demo today! Peeked at some awesome updates hitting our mobile app in (estimated) Q1 2025. Seeing the focus on performance and new features got me seriously fired up. ðŸ¤© 

Let me be clear - this was an internal quick-look, so you didn't miss out but it confirmed some exciting progress on our development roadmap.  It's fantastic to see how the team is doubling down on user efficiency and introducing some real game-change features. Keep an eye out! ðŸ˜‰

**Recommendations for either option:**

*   **Your Companyâ€™s Handle:** *Extremely* important to add your company's official LinkedIn account handle, e.g., #Google, or #Samsung.
*   **Image/Video:** A relevant image or a *tiny* clip, if permissible (even just 10 seconds) would significantly increase visibility. Even just a graphic with text ("Sneak Peak! Future Mobile Updates") works.



I've tried my best to create compelling text based on the limited info and slightly unconventional nature of the event as documented. Best of luck publishing!
